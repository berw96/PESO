-------------------------LOCAL SETUP-------------------------

1• Create a new directory and name it 'build'. This will store the solution files.
	The build directory is mentioned in the .gitignore, which is interpreted by GitHub
	as a list of folders to exclude from each push to the repository.
	

2• Using CMake, build a Visual Studio Solution file on EACH device.
	You will be asked to provide the directory containing the source files, select the entire folder.
	Specify build as the directory to store solution files.

	or

	Using a bash terminal, type in the following command whilst in the build directory:

		cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"

	The VS files should now be produced.
	If any files are missing, copy and paste them from a source.

3• COPY the 'res' (resources) folder to the build directory, don't MOVE it.
	res contains fonts which are required to play the application.
	Moving it to the build directory would stop it from being pushed to the
	repository, and cloned between devices.

4• Open the solution and right click on MyGame.sln.
	Select 'Set as startup project'.
	Go to Properties > Linker > System and change the SubSystem to CONSOLE.


---------------------------------------------------------------

Possible issues:

• The project may build fine, appear and then disappear suddenly.
	This is caused by the 'res' folder being absent in the build folder.

• The .gitignore specifies that compiled linker libraries (.dll, etc) are ignored.
This means you will have to import SDL2 manually on each device, its libraries will not
be included from a pull!

• There may be merging issues when trying to clone a repo, such that changes on the device must be
submitted before a clone can take place.
